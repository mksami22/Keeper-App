# Keeper-App
## Description:
Keeper-App is a clone of the famous application Google Keep by Google. I have tried to include the same functionalities of Google Keep in the clone. 
We can add a note by clicking on the add button or we ca just delete an added note by clicking the delete button appearing next to the note. I extensively use Google Keep and just wanted to sharpen my skills by creating its clone.
